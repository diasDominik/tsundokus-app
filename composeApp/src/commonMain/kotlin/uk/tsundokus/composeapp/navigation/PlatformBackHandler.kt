/**
 * Bridges the host platform's "back" affordance to the app's Nav3 back stack.
 *
 * Only the **web** target provides a real implementation: it wires the browser's Back button
 * (History API `popstate`) to [onBack], so navigating back in the browser pops the Compose
 * [androidx.navigation3.runtime.NavBackStack] — mirroring how Android's system back drives
 * `NavDisplay`. When [enabled] is `false` (the back stack is at its root) the web implementation
 * traps the Back press and stays in the app instead of unloading it.
 *
 * Android, iOS and desktop are no-ops: Android's system back is already consumed by `NavDisplay`'s
 * predictive-back support, and the other targets expose no equivalent host-level back affordance.
 *
 * @param enabled whether a back press should pop the stack. Pass `backStack.size > 1` so the root
 *   screen keeps the user in the app.
 * @param onBack invoked on a back press when [enabled]; typically `backStack.removeLastOrNull()`.
